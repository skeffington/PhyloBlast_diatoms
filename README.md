# PhyloBlast_diatoms
Tools for phylogenetic analysis using the MMETSP transcriptomes

At the moment this tool is a set of scripts for blasting against the diatom transcriptomes within the MMETSP databases. Basic bioinformatic skills are required to run it. I'm working on a Dockerized version incorporating all databases which will work 'out of the box' and be available as an App with a GUI on the Cyverse Discovery Environment.

Assuming you have access to a Linux machine or server, this is how to proceed.
